# Finnish Bank Account Class
Simple JavaScript class for Finnish bank accounts.

I approached this challenge with JavaScript mainly because it’s easy to deploy and I’d like to learn more about the environment. I created a simple class and a few functions to help the construction. I didn’t really encounter any big challenges, although it took some time to get the check digit calculation right.
 
My solution could be improved with error checking for crazy inputs and an UI, so that user could easily input new bank accounts.
